4 Channels Logic Level Converter
================================
Manufactured by : Geek Ammo
SKU : GMO-0001

Summary
-------
This is a simple bi-directional level converter based on the BSS138 MOSFET following the application note of AN97055 Philips Electronics and AN10441 NXP.

Description
-----------
Logic level shifting may be required when interfacing legacy devices with newer devices that use a smaller geometry process. For bidirectional bus systems like the I2C-bus, such a level shifter must also be bidirectional, without the need of a direction control signal. The simplest way to solve this problem is by connecting a discrete MOS-FET to each bus line.
